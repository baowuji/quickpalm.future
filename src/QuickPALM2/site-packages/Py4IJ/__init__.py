B{Python for ImageJ - an integration engine for Jython, Python and
ImageJ}

Py4IJ works as a plugin for ImageJ by interfacing the core engine of the
application with the Jython engine - a Java based python interpreter. This
feature allows for Jython code (Python code in essence) to easily access all
of ImageJ functions and through the use of the SRPy engine to merge these with
the power of the mathematical analysis tools available in Python. Py4IJ provides
an extendable integrated development environment (IDE) facilitating the parallel
visualization and analysis of data both in Python, Jython and ImageJ.
